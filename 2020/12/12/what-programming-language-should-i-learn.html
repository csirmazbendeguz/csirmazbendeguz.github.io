      <p>The age old question. I've been asked this multiple times recently, here are my thoughts.
</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
    <p>The long answer is: it depends.</p>
    <p>The short answer is: JavaScript.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h3>Let me explain...</h3>

    <p>
        I think most developers are familiar with the long answer: it depends on what you want to build.
        Obviously. If the person has an interest in a specific platform the answer is trivial.
        Unfortunately, that's usually not the case.
    </p>

    <p>The question is not: <em>"What programming language should I learn to build apps for Android?"</em>.</p>

    <p>The question is (rephrased): <em>"What programming language should I learn to get a job in software development?"</em>.</p>
    <p>And I think that's an entirely valid question to ask! And maybe more relevant than ever.</p>

    <p>In my opinion, the best way to switch careers into IT is with <strong>front-end web development</strong>.</p>

    <aside class="comment">
        <p>Disclaimer: I've never actually worked as a front-end developer, nor have I switched careers, so you should take my advice with a grain of salt.</p>
    </aside>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h3>Why JavaScript?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It's ubiquitous. JavaScript has a monopoly over the browsers, it's pretty much impossible to avoid. Every dev knows at least a little JS (even me!). Give in! :D</li>
        <li>Career opportunities. From small agencies to Big Tech. There's also freelancing. A person who can build beautiful web user interfaces is an asset to any software company.</li>
        <li>Lenient requirements. A lot of front-end professionals are self-taught, and I think, in general, the job requirements for front-end positions are a bit more lenient when it comes to formal education. Be prepared to get grilled on your portfolio instead!</li>
        <li>It's visual. It means you get quick feedback if you're doing something right or wrong. Also, it can be a lot of fun.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Are there any cons? Yes.</p>
    <p>JavaScript (and scripting languages in general) might not be the best for learning programming fundamentals.</p>
    <p>When I started out with PHP, object-oriented programming was a confusing mystery to me. It only started to make sense when I learned Java.</p>

    <p>Still, if you're looking for a solid career path, I think JavaScript development is a great one.</p>
