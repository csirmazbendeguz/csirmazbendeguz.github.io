        A couple years ago my workplace assessed the English skills of all employees.
    </p>
    <p>
        The teacher was really kind and professional.
        When she interviewed me she started with an innocuous question: <em>What's your favorite movie?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Sounds like an easy one! But not for me :( I was totally unprepared for personal questions like this at the time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's a rough translation of what went through my mind:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A favorite movie should be something I've watched multiple times</li>
        <li>Could it be a movie from my childhood? Disney movies sound like good candidates</li>
        <li>Nope, they aren't. What was the last time I've rewatched them? Not recently for sure</li>
        <li>There are some good movies I've seen recently but none that I've seen more than once</li>
        <li>Nothing comes to mind...</li>
        <li>Why can't I answer this simple question? Do I even know myself?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Note that this was all in my head, I haven't uttered a single word yet.
        I was so lost in my thoughts I haven't even realized I've been silent for half a minute.
    </p>
    <aside class="comment">
        <p>Imagine asking someone what their favorite movie is and getting a thousand-yard stare as a response.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>
        After I made sure the situation is as uncomfortable as possible (for no reason whatsoever),
        she patiently asked me a new question and we moved on to the rest of the interview (where I tried to
        prove that I'm not actually a brick wall - despite all evidence to the contrary).
    </p>
    <p>
        I have better social skills now, but this awkward moment is still imprinted in the part of my memory that keeps me up at night.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hayley, if you're reading this: I don't know, I don't have one. What's yours?
